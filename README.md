# LibraryX

This is my FSWD Project. 
I have created the Library Management System with HTML, CSS and JS files.
Just by downlaoding the files, and then opening in VS Studio and then running on local port live server, everything will work. Atleast they are working in my system correctly.

For the admin login, use the following credentials:

email id- admin@libraryx.com
password- adminxlib
